### What I learned ü•≥
I Learnt how to center a `<button>`, so the trick is you wrap the button with 'element wrapper' like `<div>` next in the wrapper element we can use `grid` to center it. So Easy I love it!
###### stylesheets/scss/components/\_card.scss
```scss
  .wrap-cancel {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  .cancel {
    text-align: center;
    color: $desaturated-blue;
    font-weight: map-get($font-weights, bold);
    text-decoration: none;
    &:hover {
    color: $dark-blue;
    }
  }
}
```

### Continued development
- [ ] Mobile First
- [ ] Make text for 'Annual Plan' **Bold**
